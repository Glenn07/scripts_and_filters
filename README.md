I currently work in a bank where I'm tasked with automating most of the mundane tasks. Here I'm sharing some of the scripts I've written to automate the tasks.
We use bash and python scripts. We use the ELK stack to visualize the reports gathered from the scripts so we'll have a single dashboard to monitor our environment.
